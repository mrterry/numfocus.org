John Hunter, author of `Matplotlib`_, founding board
member of `NumFOCUS`_, husband to Miriam, and father to three daughters:
Clara, Ava, and Rahel, was diagnosed with cancer in late July 2012 after
returning from his keynote `address at SciPy`_ in Austin, TX. He passed
away on August 28th from complications arising from necessary cancer
treatment. See the `announcement email`_ by his good friend, Fernando
Perez.

John has given so much to all of us in the Python community, now is our
time to give something back to his family by providing for the education
and support of his children. We have setup the John Hunter Memorial Fund
to provide a mechanism for individuals and companies who have
appreciated John's work, to give back to him by ensuring that his
children have funds available for their education.
